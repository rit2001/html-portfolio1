<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Eternal Sun-Shine of the Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>This is my favourite pshychological,romantic love story and science fiction movie. I love the wonderful story line of the this movie.</p>
<h3>Water: The  Great Mistry</h3>
<p>Scientists, philosophers and theologians try to understand water's explicit and implicit properties beyond the common physical laws of nature.</p>
<h3>Life Is Beautiful</h3>
<p>Life is Beautiful is introduced as a fable. From a Dramatica perspective, it contains two grand argument stories; a boy meets girl romantic comedy, followed by a father and son tragicomedy.</p>
